    "effect": "This weapon realigns the molecular structure of a living target, in effect crystalizing the flesh. It works at long range but has no visible manifestation (no ray or projectile). The device inflicts damage equal to its level. Further, if the target is slain by the device, the target shatters, exploding in an immediate radius with crystalline shrapnel that inflicts 3 points of damage. This device is a rapid-fire weapon, and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each \u201cround of ammo\u201d used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.",
