39,Burrowing bubble,1d6+4,"Wearable: Ring, bracelet, headband
Usable: Handheld device","Upon activation, for ten minutes, the user is surrounded by a bubble of energy that projects incredible heat outward, but not inward. This bubble floats 1 foot (0.3 m) in the air, inflicts 6 points of damage to all within immediate range, and inflicts 3 points of damage to all within short range. Further, it instantly melts the material directly below (of lower level than the cypher), and the bubble sinks an immediate distance into the new hole it created. This continues for the duration of the effect, so a user who stands on the ground when activating this cypher ends up about 800 feet (244 m) underground when it finally stops.
If the user concentrates, she can force the bubble to move an immediate distance in any direction she chooses as an action.
The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it.

The screen bears an animate image appropriate to the surrounding area, such as trees and brush in a forest, sandy dunes in a desert, and so on. Thus, anything behind the screen is easily hidden from visual observation unless the viewer is within immediate distance (and even then it may be obscured, depending on the circumstances).
[If you cobble together a camouflage screen and a pushpull beam (task difficulty 7), you create a cypher that fires a beam up to long range that encapsulates a target in a bubble of solid light about 8 feet (2 m) across.

This lasts for one round, and the Armor is ablative, which is to say that each point of damage that it absorbs destroys 1 point of the Armor.
The cypher also releases fourteen hailstonesized motes of roiling caustic fluid that fly toward and attack all targets (including the user) within immediate range, one mote per target. If there are not fourteen targets within immediate range, the motes fly out to short range. If there are not fourteen targets within short range, they fly out to long range.

53,Clone tank,10,Usable: A large glass and metal tank filled with pink slime,"To activate this device, the user must place a few drops of blood, strands of hair, nail clippings, or a piece of flesh in the slime. The slime hardens around the organic material to form a cyst. Over the next 3d6 months, the device rapidly grows a person from the material. At the end of this time, a full-grown creature, identical in every physical way to the donor creature, emerges from the tank, and the device deactivates. The clone is a level 1 creature.

The wings begin to flap, causing the device to lift into the air and fly off toward the creature whose materials were used to activate it. The device uses the datasphere to locate the creature and speeds off toward it by the shortest and fastest available route. The device flies about 30 mph (48 kph) and maneuvers around obstacles.

If there are more targets than streaks of energy, the targets are determined randomly, meaning that the user could be a target.
The streaks of energy are extradimensional conduits tying the targets to an ultraterrestrial intelligence with a level equal to the cypher level.

1 The device now also inflicts 4 points of damage if used on a target other than the user. If the device already inflicts damage, the damage is increased by 2 points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28 hours after the first use.
2 The device, when activated, also projects a force field around the user that lasts for an hour. This field provides +2 to Armor. If the device already creates protective Armor, that Armor gains +1 instead. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact. 
3 The device, when activated, also adds 1 to the user’s Might Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge for one hour. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.
4 If the device has immediate range, the range is increased to short. If short, it is increased to long. If long, it is increased to 200 feet (61 m). Such changes to the device last for 28 hours. If the device does not have a ranged effect, it instead affects the user when activated so that the user moves a long distance on an action for 28 hours. This latter effect can be used once. 
5 The device, when activated, also makes the user invisible for an hour. While invisible the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if he does something to reveal his presence or position—attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, and so on. If this occurs, he can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.
6 The device now also restores a total of 4 points each time it is activated. The user can allocate those points among his stat Pools as desired, but the Pools cannot go above their maximum. If the device already restores points to Pools, it restores 2 additional points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28 hours after the first use.",c117,SATC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When the last hour ends, the blister splits open and leaks a yellow slick of phlegmy substance.
In the midst of the mess is a level 1 creature about 18 inches (46 cm) tall. The creature can talk in any language the user knows and accompanies him wherever he goes, following his instructions. It vaguely resembles the user but is ugly and misshapen.

If the resulting number is negative, the wearer takes those points out of the next Pool in succession. For example, if the wearer is at 0 Intellect points and rolls a natural 1, she loses 1 point from her Might Pool. If her Might Pool is already at 0, the point of damage comes out of her Speed Pool instead.
[Using insanity masks to gain Intellect points always involves a risk because a bad roll can decrease your other Pools. Damage is typically applied to Pools in this order: 1. Might (unless the Pool is 0), 2. Speed (unless the Pool is 0) 3. Intellect. Thus, if someone’s Intellect Pool is at 0 when she uses the mask, any damage comes out of her Might Pool.]",no,SATC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

494,Wish disk,10,Usable: A set of metal disks nested within each other,"The user states a change in reality that she wishes to have happen, and it—or something very like it—occurs. This warping of reality can affect matter, energy, and time. Objects can be created or destroyed, creatures can be slain, and events from the past can be undone. Reality can be altered so that dead beings are still alive (because they never died).
However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples:
• A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous.
• A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble.
• Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations.
• Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage.

During this time, if the user speaks to the target in a language the target can understand, she can implant a suggestion in the target’s mind. This suggestion is a course of activity the target must follow under the specific conditions the user describes. The course of activity can be anything she chooses, though it cannot be anything that poses a significant risk to the target’s life, property, or loved ones.

Most of these cyphers have two or three prerecorded sounds (such as beastly roars, machines grinding, and an explosion with roaring fire) and the user chooses which one to activate. Some also have the ability to record a new noise. The cypher repeats the chosen recording for one minute per cypher level. Prerecorded sounds are about as loud as a ravage bear, but a user-recorded sound is exactly as loud as what the user recorded.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
545,Device stabilizer,1d6,"Usable: Small handheld device, crystal nodule affixed to cypher","When attached to a cypher of its level or lower, the stabilizer prevents that cypher from being used up when activated if the user succeeds on an understanding numenera roll (difficulty equal to the level of the attached cypher). A successful roll uses up the device stabilizer instead of the cypher it is attached to; a failed roll means the cypher is spent and useless. Some cyphers (particularly pills and injections) cannot be stabilized in this way.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
546,Diagnostic graft,1d6+1,"Internal: Pill 
Usable: Small spherical or ovoid device","When swallowed, the cypher embeds itself in the user’s body cavity and unleashes microfilaments that connect to various organs. The cypher monitors the user’s body for diseases, parasites, poisons, and contaminants. When it detects such things, it indicates their presence with a pattern of lights (visible through the user’s skin), sounds, or vibrations that show the location of the problem and the nature of the threat. The user must make a level 3 Intellect defense roll to correctly interpret the signals (such as “brain parasite,” “lung cancer,” “blood venom,” or “stomach fungus”). The alarm repeats every hour unless the user acknowledges it with a firm tap, and it repeats each day until the threat is ended. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear. At level 6 and higher, the graft can also be activated to neutralize an internal threat if it is of a lower level than the cypher, but thereafter the graft works only as a detector, like the lower-level varieties.",c548,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
547,Extradimensional limb,1d6,"Wearable: Glove, boot, adhesive patch 
Usable: Injection","For ten minutes per cypher level, the user’s affected limb becomes pandimensional, able to touch and affect extradimensional and out-of-phase creatures and objects as if they were completely solid or insubstantial (whichever the user prefers). For example, if the user’s hand is out of phase, they could punch an abykos (whether the creature is solid, partially solid, or insubstantial), reach through a solid wall, or pick up an extradimensional object. For cyphers of level 1 to 4, this pandimensional state extends just beyond the user’s flesh (including clothing and armor on that limb, a small object that can be held in a closed fist, and so on). For cyphers of level 5 or higher, the pandimensional field reaches about 6 inches (15 cm) farther, allowing the user to also affect a small weapon or tool held in that limb.
[A careful user with an extradimensional limb could attack an opponent with a phased weapon, turning the limb and weapon solid at just the right moment to bypass the foe’s Armor, but the attack would be hindered by two steps because the user would be harmed if their flesh turned solid inside the opponent.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
548,Fleshy head disguise,1d6+1,"Internal: Pill 
Wearable: Adhesive patch 
Usable: Small handheld device","Scans a creature designated by the user and creates a lifelike fleshy model of that creature’s head that can be worn as a full-head prosthetic mask. The model has muscles, nerves, and blood vessels that react to the wearer’s face and head movements, including speech, facial expressions, blushing, and blinking, but does so with the copied creature’s appearance (including scars and retinal scans). The worn model counts as two assets on disguise tasks to pretend to be the copied creature, although if the wearer has a very different shape than the copied creature, it is unlikely that anyone will believe it. The model lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which it melts into harmless goo.
[A human wearing a fleshy head disguise of a ravage bear makes for an interesting costume but won’t be mistaken for a natural ravage bear because the creatures are quadrupeds.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
549,Glue emitter,1d6,"Internal: Subdermal implant 
Wearable: Ring, wristband, pair of gloves 
Usable: Handheld device","This cypher has two modes. The default mode produces a liquid glue that hardens after a preset time (anywhere from one round to one minute) into a hard, permanent synth bond. The hardened glue has a level equal to the cypher level. The glue won’t stick to or bond with the cypher itself. The cypher can produce a line of glue that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter and about 50 feet (15 m) long, enough to affix a 10-foot (3 m) square panel to a wall or seal shut a couple of human-sized doors. Ten minutes after the cypher is first activated, the remaining glue clogs it up and makes it unusable.
In burst mode, the cypher acts much like a web detonation cypher, except the rapidly cured glue lasts only about ten minutes before degrading.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
550,Iotum tracker,1d6+2,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid 
Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet, headband, crystal worn on temple 
Usable: Small handheld device, crystal","The user learns the direction and distance to the nearest unit of iotum of a specified kind. The user must have on hand at least 1 unit of the kind of iotum desired. If the user has no iotum, the cypher searches for the highest-level iotum within very long range.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
551,Midnight field,1d6+1,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid 
Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet 
Usable: Crystal nodule affixed to armor","This cypher has two modes. In the default mode, it surrounds the user in a skintight field of absolute blackness, darker than black paint or a cloudy night under a new moon, that lasts ten minutes per cypher level. In dim light, the user is trained in stealth tasks. In very dim light or darkness, the user is specialized in stealth tasks. Because the user appears completely black (without any highlights), viewing them is slightly disorienting, and attacks against them are hindered. The field allows a small amount of light to reach the user’s eyes (otherwise, they’d be blind), and at best the user can see as if in dim light.
In cloud mode, the cypher bursts in an immediate radius, creating a cloud of darkness that lasts one minute per cypher level. The darkness is enough to obscure bright lights brought into it, but very bright light sources (such as a miniaturized star or a portal to a dimension of light) are only slightly diminished.",c553,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
552,Object micronizer,1d6+4,"Wearable: Glove 
Usable: Small handheld device, crystal nodule","Shrinks an object that the user can hold in one hand to about one-tenth its original size in all dimensions (length, width, height) and about a thousandth of its original mass. Most micronized commonplace items (weapons, tools, and so on) aren’t usable, but if the object is a cypher or artifact, it still functions, although wearable cyphers might pose a problem. If activating the normal-sized device requires manipulating switches or other controls, doing so for a micronized device is a difficulty 4 Speed roll (failure means the item doesn’t activate but isn’t used up or depleted). The shrinking lasts a number of hours equal to the micronizer’s level, after which the item returns to its normal size.
[A micronized cypher still counts toward a character’s cypher limit.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
553,Otherspace stasis chamber skeleton key,1d6+3,"Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet, headband, bracelet 
Usable: Small handheld device","Releases a creature imprisoned in an otherspace [a small artificial dimension (and access to it) or a portal to a natural alternate dimension] linked to the cypher. The creature appears up to a short distance away and is hindered on the round it appears because it is recovering from the stasis effect. The creature is not under the user’s control, and the cypher does not grant any way to communicate with it or return it to the otherspace. Depending on the creature’s nature, it is likely to fight or flee. The level of the released creature is often equal to the cypher level, but about half of these cyphers release a creature whose level is equal to the cypher level minus 2.
[Most creatures trapped in otherspaces are dangerous beasts or people. A few otherspaces contain people wishing to leave the “past” behind and wait for a more interesting future, or those who have a fatal disease or injury that could not be cured at the time they were put into stasis.]",c555,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
554,Personal telekinesis field,1d6,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid 
Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet, headband, crystal worn on temple","Surrounds the user with a thin cloud of nanites that respond to the user’s thoughts, allowing them to exert fine and precise force on objects within about 1 inch (2.5 cm). The user can move objects, push against objects, and so on, using their Intellect Pool as their Might Pool and Speed Pool, and using their Intellect Edge as Might Edge and Speed Edge. Although this power allows for very fine control (the user can tie or untie laces, activate a specific switch on a cypher, brush their hair, and so on), the limited reach of the field makes it difficult to use it directly as an attackthrowing a dagger with it would generate only as much strength as a short, quick flip with a hand. The user can’t use this telekinesis on their own body. The cloud of nanites lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
[A personal telekinesis field is useful for moving small objects around under your clothes so they can’t be found, manipulating your equipment when your hands are being watched, and other subtle tasks.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
555,Phasing detector,1d6,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid 
Wearable: Contact lenses, eyeglasses, or goggles Usable: Small handheld device, crystal","Enhances the user’s perception of extradimensional and out-of-phase creatures and objects. For the next 28 hours, the user has an asset (or two assets if the cypher is level 5 or higher) to perceive and interact with these creatures and objects, including attacking and defending against them.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
556,Precognitive focus inducer,1d6,"Internal: Pill, ingestible liquid 
Wearable: Temporary tattoo, amulet, headband, crystal worn on temple 
Usable: Small handheld device, crystal","This device interfaces with future versions of the user, granting them access to an ability the present user hasn’t learned yet. For the next hour, the user gains the focus ability from their next higher tier (up to a maximum tier equal to the cypher’s level), as if they had selected that ability as an advancement. If the ability costs Pool points to use, the character must spend them to activate the ability. If the next higher tier grants more than one ability, the user gains both abilities. If the tier allows a choice of different abilities, randomly determine which one it grants. If the user already has one of the abilities of that tier, the cypher grants the other ability from that tier, or an unselected ability from a lower tier. For example, a tier 2 Nano with the Commands Mental Powers focus who uses a level 3 version of this cypher would gain either the Psychic Burst ability or the Psychic Suggestion ability.
[If the GM is using alternative focus abilities from chapter 3, those may be options as well for a precognitive focus inducer.]
[Because the future is changeable, it is possible for two different uses of a precognitive focus inducer to grant two different abilities from the same tier. In game terms, this cypher is a fun way to allow a player to test upcoming focus abilities and choose the ones they like the best.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
557,Puppeteering sleeves,1d6+4,"Wearable: Pair of sleeves, linked bands, or fine wire or mesh that encircles the wearer’s arms","Allows the wearer to record physical actions for up to one minute per cypher level and perform those actions at will for up to one hour per cypher level. For example, the wearer could watch someone tie a complex knot, reassemble a dismantled device, stylishly flip a dagger from one hand to the other, and perform a complicated secret handshake, all within the recording period, then repeat any of those actions at will within the performance period. Because the repeated action is based on the wearer’s perception of the recorded task, it isn’t always perfect (the GM may decide that the task is hindered). Performing a recorded action costs as many Pool points as the original action does.
[The GM may allow the wearer of puppeteering sleeves to copy fighting moves and other purely physical abilities if they don’t rely on nanotechnology, psychic ability, extradimensional power, and so on. Essentially, anything that a normal human could do with proper training can potentially be copied.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
558,Synthrope dispenser,1d6,"Internal: Ingestible liquid 
Wearable: Wrist-mounted projector 
Usable: Handheld device","Creates a rope made of clear flexible synth, up to a total of 20 feet (6 m) per cypher level. (If the cypher is an ingestible liquid, the rope is pulled out of the drinker’s mouth.) The rope is actually a twisted hollow cylinder and, if cut, the ends can be sealed with heat to create clear synth bags that are about 1 foot (30 cm) wide and as long as desired.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
559,Time skipper,1d6+4,"Internal: Pill 
Wearable: Adhesive patch, amulet, bracelet, headband 
Usable: Small handheld device","Skips the user forward in time in the same physical spot they left. To them, no time passes. To all others, the user vanishes in a flash and returns later in another flash. Most cyphers (levels 5 to 7) send the user forward a few minutes in time, some (levels 8 or 9) skip forward a couple of hours, and a few (level 10) skip multiple days.
[Because the timeskipping character reappears in the same spot despite the world orbiting through space, stellar and galactic movement, and so on, there must be something that compensates for these shifts. If a time skipper is used on a spacecraft, it may not be so reliable.]",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
560,Toglit creche,1d6+2,"Usable: Small handheld device, canister","Synthesizes and releases a batch of 1d6 pigeon-sized creatures called troglits [level 1] that wander the area in search of food. Troglits are slow, harmless, and omnivorous. They may have features of any kind of animal family (mammal, bird, reptile, fish, insect, and so on) and can subsist on scrub grass, bark, manure, and other organic materials that humans can’t eat. After one day of eating its fill, a troglit grows to twice its original size and gives birth to 1d6 immature troglits. Troglits are palatable and nutritious. They are genetically programmed to become sterile after a number of days equal to the cypher level after the initial batch, no matter what generation they are (so all troglits from a level 3 cypher become sterile three days after the cypher is activated).
[Aeon Priests believe that troglits were created to be temporary pets or emergency food sources.]",c562,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561,Ventriloquist,1d6,"Wearable: Disk that adheres to throat, tiny nodule held in mouth 
Usable: Small handheld device, injector","When activated, the cypher splits into two pieces. One is placed or thrown somewhere, and the other remains attached to the user. At any time, the user can speak normally, project their voice through the other piece of the cypher (up to very long range), or both. The remote piece sounds exactly like the user, and the sound is as loud as the user’s actual voice (twice as loud if the cypher is level 3 or higher). The effect lasts for one hour per cypher level.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
562,Voicebox graft,1d6+1,Usable: Small metallic disk,"When applied to a living creature’s head, the disk immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the device reacts to the creature’s ability to communicate and make concepts, translating those impulses into audible words in a specific language keyed to the graft. The graft gives the creature a vocabulary of ten words per cypher level, although very simple creatures might be able to use far fewer. Typical words in a creature’s vocabulary are: hunger, hunt, food, danger, predator, prey, left, right, up, down, move, stop, fast, slow, cold, hot, pain, fear. If a creature is capable of learning vocal commands or pet tricks, those words are suitable additions to its spoken vocabulary. At cypher level 4 and higher, the graft has a limited machine intelligence that adds some syntax to the creature’s words so it is easier to understand.",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
563,Wasp drone,1d6,Usable: Fingertip-sized winged insect built of synth and biological elements,"This voice-controlled cyberbug travels to a designated area the user can see within a very long distance (if the user has line of sight to a particular creature, they can designate that creature as well). The bug flies to that area, moving a long distance each round, and makes a nuisance of itself, attacking creatures randomly (if the user designated a creature, it attacks only that creature). The cyberbug is a creature whose level equals the cypher’s level, and it inflicts 1 point of Speed damage. The bug dies after ten minutes of activity or after it makes one successful attack (two attacks if the cypher level is 5 or higher).",no,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
564,Water spigot,1d6+2,"Wearable: Glove 
Usable: Handheld device","This cypher has two modes. In the default mode, it produces a constant stream of water, anywhere from 1 to 3 gallons (about 4 to 11 liters) per minute [typical faucet: 2 gpm]. This ends when it has released about 100 gallons (380 liters) of water per cypher level. The water may be fresh, salt, brackish, or contaminated with some other substance (such as sewage or pollutants).
In burst mode, the device sprays a jet of high-velocity water up to a long distance away, using about 100 gallons of the cypher’s capacity in one round. The jet inflicts 1 point of damage and may knock the target prone or move it away from the user. The jet can be used as a rapid-fire weapon, allowing characters with the Spray fighting move (or similar abilities) to make up to three attempts to hit a target. After the initial burst, the remainder of the cypher’s water pours out at the default mode rate.
[The water from a water spigot cypher might be pulled from a nearby source, fabricated by nanites, or diverted from another dimension.]",c566,AEON,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
565,Waterproofing spray,1d6+4,Usable: Spray canister,"An object sprayed by this cypher repels water as if protected by an incredibly thin and specialized force field. The object has Armor against water-based attacks (such as acid, sprayed venom, or electricity conducted through water) equal to the cypher’s level for 28 hours.
